	- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
	- BAD: the beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
	- BAD: in the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
	- BAD: For the sentence structure we want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

	Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible vocabulary list to get us started:
	|Japanese |	Romaji | English |
	|		  | kuma   | bear |
	|		  | tobira | door |
	|		  | gomi   | garbage |
	|		  | suteru | to throw away/to leave out |
	|	   	  | miru   | to see/to look |
	Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?" We'll need to use a conjunction to connect these two clauses.
	Here's a question to get us started: How would you say "bear" in Japanese? Would you use the singular or plural form?

    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |

    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |
    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action
    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
